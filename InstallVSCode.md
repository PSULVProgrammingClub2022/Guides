# Extensions
Extensions are a really powerful feature of VSC that allow you to add more functionality to your environment
Here are a few extensions I recomend

1. Remote - SSH
2. ESLint
3. JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
4. npm
5. Prettier
6. Code Runner
7. IF you are using WSL, I also recommend Remote Development and Remote - WSL
