# Extensions
Extensions are a really powerful feature of VSC that allow you to add more functionality to your environment
Here are a few extensions I recomend

1. Remote - SSH
2. ESLint
3. JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
4. npm
5. Prettier
6. Code Runner
7. IF you are using WSL, I also recommend Remote Development and Remote - WSL

You can also install extensions for your programming language simply by searching its name

# How to setup VSC Remote
In order to give everyone a standard environment and simplify the development process, everyone will have access to an account on a server with everything you will need to use pre-installed. You can use the Remote - SSH extension to access files on the remote server with VS Code.
1. Select the Remote Window Button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3160083/141035664-c0161759-7e55-4925-a2d8-96c3ec8e19f1.png)
